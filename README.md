# README

This project use `python` and `flask` to build REST API's \
If flask is not available install it using 
```
pip3 install Flask
```
`app.py` is the controller and can be run by the command 
```
python3 app.py
```
The app is running on the port `8000` and can be accessed by 
```
http://localhost:8000/
```
The API are not protected by any means of authentication or authorization, So, the end points can be accessed directly. \
Attached a file `Fetch API's.postman_collection.json` which has the list of API's. 
This file can be imported into the postman desktop app to test.
